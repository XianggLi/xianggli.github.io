      <p>
        My cat's full name is Yuan Li (taking my last name, apparently, lol). He is an American Shorthair and just turned 7 years old (born in April 2016). Yuan loves to sleep and stay by my side (let's hope so).

        During Yuan's free time (he could be pretty busy waking me up in the morning, thank you, Yuan), his favorite activity is watching the wild turkeys outside from our window. He also enjoys going for short walks with me to explore the surroundings, although he's not a fan of wet floors, so he prefers to stay indoors after the snow melts. I am really looking forward to trying to take him near the lake this summer.
