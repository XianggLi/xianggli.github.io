      <p>
        Yuan is an American Shorthair cat born in China. He holds a Master's degree and is now pursuing a PhD degree in Industrial Engineering, specializing in the field of cat ergonomics. His research focuses on the methodology of studying the interaction between cats and their living environment. He is well-known as an expert in properly applying these methodologies to create an environment that meets the physiological and psychological needs of cats, with the goal of improving efficiency, safety, health, and comfort during activities such as sleeping and eating.
        
        Currently, Yuan also serves as Xiang Li's life and career development consultant, providing her with crucial advice and guidance on how to improve the quality of life for household members and choose a career path to increase their family income. They collaborated to publish 'Family Financial Resource Planning: A Two-Stage Mixed Integer Optimization Model', which presents an innovative extension of the two-stage optimization framework for non-convex optimization problems under small-scale data.

        During Yuan's free time (he could be quite busy sometimes), his favorite pastime is observing the wild turkeys outside through our window. Additionally, he relishes accompanying Xiang on brief strolls to discover the surrounding areas.
